## The four different viewport units are:

- vw: 10vw would be 10% of the viewport's width.
- vh: 3vh would be 3% of the viewport's height.
- vmin: 70vmin would be 70% of the viewport's smaller dimension (height vs. width).
- vmax: 100vmax would be 100% of the viewport's bigger dimension (height vs. width).

``` 
<style>
  h2{ 
      width: 80vw; 
  }

  p {
      width: 75vmin;
  }
</style>
